Summary
-------

Stop spam and bots with PlayThru, the fun, free CAPTCHA alternative! 
CAPTCHAs infuriate users, increase drop-off, and ruin your site's experience. 
PlayThru is the game-based alternative that people love. It's completely free, 
and it could be on your site in less than five minutes.

Our games take 5 to 10 seconds to complete, versus the 12 second average of 
CAPTCHA. PlayThru also increases form submissions by up to 40% over other 
CAPTCHA options.

Our games are built in HTML5, with Flash as an automatic fallback for older 
browsers. And getting the game "right" isn't enough--our backend algorithms 
actually track how you play each game, so we even stop bots that figure out 
how to follow the game's instructions.
